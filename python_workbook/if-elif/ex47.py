"""Exercise 47: Birth Date to Astrological Sign
The horoscopes commonly reported in newspapers use the position of the sun at the
time of oneâ€™s birth to try and predict the future. This system of astrology divides the
year into twelve zodiac signs, as outline in the table below:

    Capricorn           December 22 to January 19
    Aquarius            January 20 to february 18
    Pisces              February 19 to March 20
    Aries               March 21 to April 19
    Taurus              April 20 to May 20
    Gemini              May 21 to June 20

    # check for the leap year so that a valid date in the feb month is accepted
    answer = input("Is the year you have born is leap year(Y/N)? ").upper()
    if answer == 'Y':
        if date in range(19, 30):
