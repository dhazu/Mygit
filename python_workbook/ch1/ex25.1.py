"""Exercise 25: Units of Time (Again)
(Solvedâ€”24 Lines)
In this exercise you will reverse the process described in the previous exercise.
Develop a program that begins by reading a number of seconds from the user.
Then your program should display the equivalent amount of time in the form
D:HH:MM:SS, where D, HH, MM, and SS represent days, hours, minutes and sec-
onds respectively. The hours, minutes and seconds should all be formatted so that
they occupy exactly two digits, with a leading 0 displayed if necessary."""
#Solution:
S = int(input("Enter how many seconds:"))
# Now calculte the number of days from the given number of seconds
D = S//(3600*24)
# Now calculte the remaining time after division
S = S%(3600*24)
# print the number of days
print(D,":",sep="",end="")
# Now calculte the number of hours from the remaining seconds
H = S//3600
# Now calculate the remaining time after the division
S = S%3600
# Now calculate the tens and ones digit of hours
tens = H//10
ones = H%10
# print the number of hours
print("%d%d"%(tens,ones),":",sep='',end='')
# Now calculate the number of minutes from the remaining time
M = S//60
# Now calculate the reminder after the division
S = S%60
# Now calculate the tens and ones digit of minutes
tens = M//10
ones = M%10
# Print the number of minutes
print("%d%d" %(tens,ones),":",sep="",end='')
# Now calculate the tens and ones digit of the remaining time
tens = S//10
ones = S%10
# Print the tens and ones digit of the remaining seconds
print("%d%d" %(tens,ones),sep='')
